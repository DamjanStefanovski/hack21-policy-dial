BigID hackathon 2021 - Idea - Policy Dial

### Policy Dial - A dial based visualization designed for stakeholders (e.g. data-stewards) to show/track data-remediation progress on  defined policies against a preset time period (daily/weekly/monthly).

Visualization is renderred using an intuitive dial that displays policy findings using a dial (guage). At the highiest level it provides summary stats showing triggered policies findings v/s total policies defined. You can drilldown (click/navigate/swipe) from here to see several similar summary dials at the policy-type level. A futher drilldown from here provides details of individual policy findings under a specific category.
